    Checks whether there exists an assignment in which every player receives a bundle

    This is step 1 of the algorithm – Threshold Selection.
    We choose a threshold value t and try to determine whether there exists an allocation

    Later, the algorithm performs binary search on t to find the maximum feasible threshold.
    This function helps determine whether, for a given t, there exists a valid allocation that satisfies all players.

    Builds a bipartite hypergraph where hyperedges represent fat or thin bundles
    with total value at least the given threshold.

    Explanation:
    This is step 4 of the algorithm – hypergraph construction.
    We build a hypergraph where:
    - One side contains the players.
    - The other side contains the items.
    - Each fat or thin bundle from the fractional allocation becomes a hyperedge.
    Specifically:
    - For each fat item assigned to a player, we create a hyperedge {i, j}.
    - For each thin bundle, we ensure that the removal of any item would
      cause the bundle's value to drop below 1 — meaning all items are essential.

    The goal of the hypergraph is to enable a search for a perfect matching in the next step.

    """
    Performs local search to find a perfect matching in the hypergraph —
    each player is matched to a separate bundle whose value is at least the threshold.

    Explanation:
    This is step 5 of the algorithm – local search for a perfect matching in the hypergraph.
    The algorithm incrementally builds a perfect matching using alternating trees and augmenting edges.
    The idea is to start from an empty matching and expand it step by step:
    - Select an unmatched player.
    - Construct an alternating tree rooted at that player.
    - Search for an augmenting edge (non-blocking) to extend the matching.

    The algorithm guarantees that each player receives a disjoint bundle
    with total value at least t.
